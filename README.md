# Wikipedia-Game-OpenAI-
The code here allows an LLM from OpenAI to automatically play the Wikipedia game "[5 Clicks to Jesus]([url](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_Game))". I am sure that a more experienced programmer could have coded it all in under an hour.

It will require a functional OpenAI API key and the prior installation of the following modules:
- selenium
- openai

The program is fairly sluggish as it is lumberingly slow to scrape all of the links from the active Wikipedia page.

Feel free to suggest or make improvements.
